			Open Duka is a project designed by the <a class="oi" href="https://www.openinstitute.com/">Open Institute</a> that will provide a freely accessible database of information on Kenyan entities. 
		<br />
		<br />
			This information will provide citizens, journalists, and civic activists with a practical and easy-to-use tool to understand the ownership structure of the world they live in, demonstrating the practical applications of open information for normal citizens. 
			It will serve as a core dataset for citizens, journalists, and civic activists who want to build 3rd party public transparency and public accountability apps or services, by allowing them to cross reference the Open Duka company shareholder data against other datasets.
		<br />
		<br />
			The project aims to scrape data from various sources that range from shareholder information, procurement information, legal cases and company information.
